# Weather Prediction Model

"This repository contains code for predicting weather patterns using machine learning algorithms. The dataset is loaded using popular Python libraries like Pandas and Sklearn. The analysis includes data visualization, data preprocessing, model training and model diagnostics. 
The Models used in the prediction model are 
1. Ridge Linear Regression
2. Backtest model

# Project Overview
We'll build a system to make historical predictions. Then, we'll add more predictors to improve the model. We'll end with how to make next-day predictions.

Project Steps

1. Download weather data
2. Clean and graph data
3. Create a testing framework
4. Improve model accuracy

# Dataset 
The Dataset is taken from the NOAA(National Centres for Environmental Information) and loaded using the Pandas library. The Dataset contains information such as the name of the place, Precipitation conditions, Snow density, maximum temperature, and many more.

# Data Visualisation 
Several data visualizations are performed using Sklearn to gain insights into the data and understand the correlation among different determining parameters.

# Data Preprocessing 
Data is pre-processed to remove missing values and eliminate the null factors. Valid columns are identified that could be used to predict tomorrow's temperature. 

# Data Evaluation
The accuracy of each model is evaluated using confusion matrices and testing accuracy on the test data.
